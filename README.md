# recipe-itslearning
A plugin to add [ItsLearning](https://itslearning.com/) to [Franz.](https://meetfranz.com/)

For a more extensive look at Franz and how plugins are made for it I suggest looking at their [Github.](https://github.com/meetfranz/plugins)

## Installation
1. To install this plugin to Franz download this repository.
2. Open the Franz Plugins folder on your machine and create the dev folder if it does not exist.
  * Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Franz/recipes/dev/`
  * Windows: `%appdata%/Franz/recipes/dev/`
  * Linux: `~/.config/Franz/recipes/dev/` 
3. Add a itslearning folder and place the repository files in there.
4. Restart Franz and you should now see a Development category under services with ItsLearning inside.
